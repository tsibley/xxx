List, filter, and edit XXX/TODO/FIXME remarks in a collection of files.

In a git repository, this command will only search files tracked by git,
limited by the paths given on the command-line.

Outside a git repository, this command walks the filesystem starting with the
given paths.  If no paths are given, it starts from the current directory.  If
a git respository (a directory with a .git directory) is encountered during
this walk, only the files tracked by git in the repository are searched.

Output of --list is automatically paged through XXX_PAGER, PAGER, or less.

positional arguments:
  <path>                Limit output of remarks to those in the given paths.
                        Defaults to searching the current directory.

optional arguments:
  -l, --list            List remarks for the given paths
  -e, --edit            Edit remarks for the given paths using vim's quickfix
                        list. Set XXX_EDITOR to use your preferred editor.
  -w <word>, --with <word>
                        Limit output of remarks to those with the given
                        keyword. May be used more than once.
