usage: xxx [-l | --list]  [--branch] [--with <word>] [<path> [<path> ...]]
       xxx [-c | --count] [--branch] [--with <word>] [<path> [<path> ...]]
       xxx [-e | --edit]  [--branch] [--with <word>] [<path> [<path> ...]]
       xxx --version
       xxx --help

List, count, and edit XXX/TODO/FIXME remarks in a collection of files.

In a git repository, this command will only search files tracked by git,
limited by the paths given on the command-line.  The -b / --branch option will
cause this command to only include remarks added by the current branch.  Set
xxx.branch in your git config (per repo or globally) to automatically enable
the --branch option.

Outside a git repository, this command walks the filesystem starting with the
given paths.  If no paths are given, it starts from the current directory.  If
a git respository (a directory with a .git directory) is encountered during
this walk, only the files tracked by git in the repository are searched.

Paths matching any glob-style patterns listed in an ~/.xxxignore file are
ignored.

Output of --list is automatically paged through XXX_PAGER, PAGER, or less.

positional arguments:
  <path>                Limit output of remarks to those in the given paths.
                        Defaults to searching the current directory.

optional arguments:
  -l, --list            List remarks for the given paths
  -j, --json            List remarks for the given paths as JSON
  -c, --count           Count remarks for the given paths
  -e, --edit            Edit remarks for the given paths using vim's quickfix
                        list. Set XXX_EDITOR to use your preferred editor.
  -w <word>, --with <word>
                        Limit output of remarks to those with the given
                        keyword. May be used more than once.
  -b [<ref>], --branch [<ref>]
                        Limit output of remarks to those added by the current
                        git branch since diverging from the given ref.
                        Defaults to master if no ref is given.
  --no-branch           Do not limit output of remarks to those added by the
                        current git branch since diverging from the given ref.
                        Disables a previously given -b or --branch option and
                        reading of xxx.branch from git config.
  -A <n>, --after <n>   Include <n> lines after a remark for context.
  -h, --help            Show this help
  -v, --version         Show the version of xxx
